<p>IE 9 doesn't enforce localStorage quotas when setting values via bracket notation.</p>
<p>This test will store 6 MB of data into localStorage, then reload the page and show
the first and last values that were stored. The last value will be undefined because
it exceeded the storage quota, even though no error was thrown.</p>
